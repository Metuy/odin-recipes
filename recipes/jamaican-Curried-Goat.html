        <h5> Steps </h5>
            <ol>
                    <li>Combine goat meat, chile pepper, curry powder, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. 
                        <br>Cover and refrigerate to allow flavors to blend, 1 hour to overnight.</li>
                    <li>Remove goat meat mixture from bowl and pat dry, reserving marinade. 
                        <br>Heat vegetable oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook meat in batches, browning on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes per batch.
                        <br> Transfer meat to a plate. Add onion and celery to the stockpot; cook and stir until onion begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir browned goat meat into onion mixture. Add reserved marinade, vegetable broth, and bay leaf.
                        <br> Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. 
                        <br>Stir in potatoes; simmer until potatoes and meat are tender, 35 to 45 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Remove stockpot from heat, skim off surface fat, and remove bay leaf.</li>
            </ol>
